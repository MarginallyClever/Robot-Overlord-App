 * This includes the {@link com.marginallyclever.ro3.view.View} annotation for marking classes
 * that provide views for specific data types, the {@link com.marginallyclever.ro3.view.ViewProvider}
 * interface for defining how these views are provided, and the
 * {@link com.marginallyclever.ro3.view.ViewFinder} class for locating and instantiating view providers
 * based on the type of data being rendered.
