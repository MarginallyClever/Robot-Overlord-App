Robot Overlord is an open-source 3D interface for simulating and controlling robots through a node-based visual programming system. Think of it as a lightweight, easier-to-use alternative to ROS, with a built-in 3D engine and real-time feedback.

Whether you're controlling DIY robots or developing custom simulations, Robot Overlord provides a visual, modular approach that makes robotics more accessible for makers, educators, and hobbyists.

## ‚ú® Features

üß© Visual Programming: Create complex robot behaviors using a node graph system.

ü§ñ Hardware Control: Supports live control of DIY robots via serial or network communication.

üåê 3D Simulation: Preview and test robot kinematics in a built-in OpenGL scene.

üìê Multiple Robot Types:

- 5/6 DOF arms: like [AR4](https://www.anninrobotics.com/) and [Meca500](https://mecademic.com/products/meca500-industrial-robot-arm/)
- Stewart Platforms (flight simulators)
- Bipeds, quadrupeds, hexapods
- Custom DIY solutions easily extensible in Java
