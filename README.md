![Preview image](Screenshot.png)

Robot Overlord is 3D control software for robots.  It is intended to be easier than ROS.  It was started by [Marginally Clever Robots, Ltd.](http://www.marginallyclever.com/)

We would love to see your robot run in the app.  Please joint our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Q5TZFmB) and talk live with a human!  

Some of the robots it can simulate include:

- 5 and 6 DOF Robot arms: Sixi 3, AR4, Meca500, and more.
- Stewart Platforms (flight simulators)
- 2 legged walkers (bipeds)
- 4 legged walkers (dog robots)
- 6 legged walkers (crabs, spiders)

## Why

The short answer?  ROS is too hard.  We want to make it easier.
