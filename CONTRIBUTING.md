The following is a set of guidelines for contributing.  These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes.

- Reporting bugs
- Writing code
- Contributing new code to the project
- Discussing features
- Code of conduct

## Reporting bugs
Please use the Github [Issues](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Robot-Overlord-App/issues) and fill out the template to make good bug reports.

## Contributing new code

Please see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Robot-Overlord-App/wiki/Getting-Started) to get setup and running.

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Write tests for your code.
3. Write code that passes your tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Send in your [pull request](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Robot-Overlord-App/pulls).
6. Discuss the changes with the team.
7. Get the code approved and merged into the `master` branch.

### License 

By sending in new code you agree that it will be covered by the existing license - GNU General Public License v2.0.

## Discussing features

First please check out our [Road map](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Robot-Overlord-App/wiki/Road-Map) of where we'd like to go.  This direction informs our plan of attack.


## Code of conduct

It's not hard: Don't be a jerk.
